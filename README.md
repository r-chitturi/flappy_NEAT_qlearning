### **NEAT-Python**
NEAT-Python is a package that implements the NEAT (Neuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm. NEAT creates an artificial neural network that learns the suitable topology and weight values for the neural network.

### **Q-learning**
Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm. It learns the values of the optimal policy independently of the agent's current policy to maximize the reward by finding the best action to take given the current state.
